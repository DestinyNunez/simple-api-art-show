#Virtual Art Gallery

### Goal: Create a virtual art showcase. The showcase will display information about the art piece if available.





### How It's Made:
To create this app I used HTML and CSS for structure and style. For the positioning of elements I used Flexbox.

###Functionality
For this project I implemented Javascript alongside the Metropolitan Museum of Art API. I utilized the API to collect information such as artwork images, origin, artist name, culture where the art is derived from as well as what the item is such as bowl, door, lamp etc. I took this information and passed it through the API so that the user could learn more about artwork, as they would in an in-person art gallery.
